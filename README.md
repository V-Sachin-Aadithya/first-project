# first-project
This is my first project as an aspiring full stack developer. 

This above project is basically a simple seat selector where seats can be selected and highlighted and cant be reselected.
What I learnt is I have still not quite grasped javascript as a lang. I had to look up that part a lot but I intend to revisit this project later on and make it better.
